"Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?"

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I have some prior python experience that I would like to build upon.
Additionally I am very interested in learning about machine learning so I think this course will be a great
introduction to the topic, and help me build a strong foundation to be able to learn even more complex topics in this field.
